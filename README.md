# Recent Projects
This document includes some projects completed in last year. 
Most of them are courses'projects that do not contain any research elements.
Thoese codes are only used to show some ideas. Please do not copy them for other use. 


## Game -- AI -- Artificial Intelligence

### Sokoban
* Python
* In these part, you can find the most classic searching algorithms and some basic heuristic functions.
* For detailed ideas, you can have a look at ReadMe.pdf file.
* Don't know what is Sokoban? Don't worry, please google it.
* I'm not sure if it works or not, please contact me if you meet any problem. (sunny_0827@126.com)
* To Run: please have a look at the begaining part in ReadMe.pdf file.

### Gomoku
* Python
* Don't know what is Gomoku? Don't worry, please google it.
* The instructor held a competition on our Gomoku Agents in class and I got Top 3 (There were no battles among top 3).
* Key points: -> How to design heuristic function?
              -> How to speed up?
* My agent is smart engouth to make a trade off between searching area and benefits. It will never spend more than 10 seconds to give a wonderful move. 
* There are two players. You can try both. 
* Don't you want to know how to design a smart game agent? Please have a look at the ReadMe.pdf file to find out your answers.

### Matching
* Lisp
* Pattern Matching -- same way with Regular Expression (see re in python)

### BlackJack
* Python
* Traditional BlackJack game. Undergoing...
* For Fun.


## NLP -- Natural Language Processing

### Tagger
* Python
* Viterbi Tagger

### Parser
* Python

### Translator
* Python



## SET -- Search Engine Technology

### Information Retrieval System
* Python
* For detailed requirment, you can see http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~cs6998/hw.html Hw1
* I did some optimization, especially on ranking function.
* To Run:  execute query.py (double click or 'python query.py' by command line)
           follow the instructions and look through requirements for detailed boolean query formats.

### Sentiment Analysis
* Python & Shell
* For detailed requirement, you can see http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~cs6998/hw.html Hw2
* Professor held a competition on thie project in class. I got the fourth place using self written a Variant Naive Bayes classifier. Top three all used SVM as classifier which is much more powerful on bi-category classification.My advantages is the preprocessing before polarity classification.
* The procedure is very classic in sentiment analysis: firtly do subjectivity analysis, then do polarity analysis. Normally, this amount of work might equal to a master's thesis, however, I only spend a week's spare time to complete the whole project.
* Codes are hidden, but the report is worth reading.

## SWT -- Sementic Web Technology
New trend for future internet.

### Ontology Alignment
* Java, rdf, owl
* Jenna API

### Reasoning
* Java, rdf, owl


## R code Samples

In this part, I provided some simple r code examples.
