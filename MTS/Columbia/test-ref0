The Press Trust of India quoted the government minister for relief and rehabilitation Kadam as revealing today that in the last week , the monsoon has started in all of India's states one after another , and that the financial losses and casualties have been serious in all areas . Just in Maharashtra , the state which includes Mumbai , India's largest city , the number of people known to have died has now reached 358 .
Reports say that Kadam made the above statement to media and journalists as he was making an inspection of Mumbai .
He said that Maharashtra , which is also India's biggest cotton-producing state , was entirely covered with a vast expanse of water , and there were cities and towns numbering 27 and about 2000 villages which had been hit by serious flooding . More than 10000 affected people had been evacuated to safe shelters .
The whole of India , from south to north , started to progressively enter the monsoon season a week ago . The residents of each state all greeted the heavy rains as relief at the end of a long drought , but didn't expect that the rain would come with unexpected violence , a real deluge . Highways have become rivers ; houses in low-lying areas have been surbmerged in the water ; the transport system is nearly paralyzed . To date , figures show that nearly 500 people have unfortunately lost their lives to the floods .
The Institute for Science and International Security , a US think tank , today reported that commercial satellite images have shown that Iran is digging a tunnel in a mountain near the Natanz uranium enrichment facility , which may be for protecting nuclear facilities in the event of air strikes .
The images were taken by US company DigitalGlobe ( DigitalGlobe ) on June 11 and have been posted on the ISIS website .
The Insitute , located in Washington DC , is a non-profit research organization .
The images show that road building is going on through the mountains just 2.4 kilometers south of the Natanz facility , and within that facility is a uranium enrichment plant .
Analysts Albright and Brannan say in a report that the entrance and exit of the tunnel in the images are not clear , but that `` one of the roads seems to lead into a tunnel facility . The other road may also lead to a tunnel entrance / exit . ''
They say : `` A tunnel facility inside a mountain like this would be of great use in terms of protection during an air strike . ''
The month-long state of emergency declared by the Palestinian authorities after Hamas militants occupied the Gaza Strip comes to an end today . Prime Minister Fayyad offered resignation temporarily , but was immediately ordered to take responsibility for forming a new government .
Minister for Agriculture and Social Affairs Habbash told AFP : `` Prime Minister Fayyad offered his resignation to President Abbas . The president accepted it and at the same time also asked him to form a new cabinet government to be responsible for routine administration . ''
Amr , an advisor to Abbas , told AFP that Fayyad had tendered his resignation , but that Abbas had ordered him to `` act in his current position until he has formed a new government . ''
The resignation of Fayyad , who is a highly respected economist , was merely a procedural resignation , and will not affect his position as prime minister .
Fayyad has led Palestine's emergency cabinet since the 17th of last month , being responsible for executing Abbas's state of emergency decree after Hamas's violent occupation of Gaza .
According to the basic law of the Palestinian self-rule government , a state of emergency cannot exceed 30 days without the agreement of the parliament , but the autonomous parliament is currently paralyzed .
The emergency government's authority expires today .

As the minutes and seconds go by , there have been positive developments in the situation . South Korean officials held talks with the Taliban for the first time today .

US Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived yesterday on a visit to China . The US is currently doing all it can to persuade China to carry out further necessary economic reforms and work on environmental protection . The renminbi exchange rate is an issue that will receive particular attention .
US diplomats say that Paulson first visited Xining , capital city of China's large northwestern province of Qinghai .
China is currently carrying out a series of plans for environmental protection near the largest freshwater lake in Qinghai Province .
Today Paulson will move on to Beijing to discuss pushing for progress in the US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue started last year and other issues with Chinese chief officials .
The US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly discusses economic , environmental protection and other issues . Yet , the most important is the issue of the renminbi exchange rate . US congressmen believe that the renminbi is excessively undervalued .
The trade deficit between the US and China is quickly escalating . Internal pressure within the US is gradually rising , and congressmen are ready to take retributive action to resist what they call China's unfair trade policies .
Last week the US Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly approved a bill requiring the Treasury to identify a list of countries with `` fundamentally misaligned '' currency exchange rates . This opens the door for potential economic sanctions to be brought against Beijing .
US congressmen say that the renminbi is undervalued , which makes the price of goods that China sells to the US extremely cheap , and adds to the trade imbalance between the US and China . Last year the US's trade deficit with China reached 232.5 billion US dollars .

According to a report on Xinhuanet .com , when the opposition representatives submitted the written plea to Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hakubun Shimomura , they requested Abe to reply before the 14th of this month . Shimomura said he would pass the message to Prime Minister Abe .
On that day , about 70 people , consisting of Nagasaki civil organization members , nuclear bomb explosion victims , and so on , staged a silent sit-in at Nagasaki Peace Park . They also read out letters that opposed the instigation for Japan to go nuclear , and requested the Japanese government to establish the Three Non-nuclear Principles as a law .
According to a report by Kyodo News Agency , that evening Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that `` everyone sees eye-to-eye regarding the guideline on adhering to the Three Non-nuclear Principles , and therefore there is no problem .
There will not be a ( recall ). ''
Since October 9 when North Korea announced that it would perform nuclear tests , Shoichi Nakagawa , Chairman of the Policy Research Council of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party , asserted on several different occasions that Japan should engage in discussions on whether to possess nuclear weapons .
Following this , Aso gave remarks on allowing discussions on whether Japan should possess nuclear weapons . The Japanese opposition parties raised strong criticisms regarding this and demanded his resignation .

Chinanews.com , July 4 The intermediate court of Linfen Municipality in Shanxi Province this morning began the first instance hearing in the `` illegal brick kiln '' case of Wang Bingbing of Caosheng Village , Guangshengsi Township , Hongdong County , Shanxi , amid great public interest .

Prior to this , the condition of Wang Yan , who was injured in competition , had been steadily improving . The recovery of strength in her left and right arms had improved by `` two points '' compared to over ten days before .

`` The doctors say that the strength in Wang Yan's right arm has reached more than 4 , just one point lower than the normal score of 5. The strength in her left arm is also over 3 , " said Wu Xiqin .
That is to say , in less than half a month's time , Wang Yan's arm strength has recovered by `` two points . ''

Wu Xiqin said that Wang Yan's current exercises mainly focused on `` sitting . '' `` She can maintain a seated posture on a bench for a while , but still not for too long . '' ( Correspondent Wang Chunqiu )
Last night Beijing time , the special hearing held by the FIA World Motor Sports Council in Paris over the Ferrari engineer spy case came to a close . McLaren , who had been summoned , managed a lucky escape : the council decided not to impose any penalty on McLaren for the time being .
The FIA official website published a statement after the hearing , saying : `` Vodafone McLaren Mercedes was in possession of confidential Ferrari information , but at present there is insufficient evidence to show that this information was used improperly in the FIA Formula One World Championship . Therefore no penalty will be imposed . ''
However , this does not definitively close the Ferrari engineer spy case .
The Motor Sports Council also said in this decision : `` If it is found in the future that the information relating to Ferrari has been used to the detriment of the championship , we reserve the right to request McLaren to return to WMSC for a hearing . At that time , they may face the penalty of the cancellation of their qualification to take part in the 2007 championship and even the 2008 championship . ''
Mike Coughlan , the former chief designer for McLaren who has now been suspended from his job , has been found to have been in possession of nearly 800 pages of Ferrari's technical documents . The contents included sets of details of the design , power , construction , checks , tests , development and operation of Ferrari's 2007 race car .
McLaren insists that no-one else in the team knew about this information before Coughlan was suspended from his job , and that the McLaren car for this season has no elements from Ferrari .

In Prague , people who are walking dogs can be seen everywhere . Dogs are also allowed on public buses .
The reporter was not used to this at all when he first arrived in the Czech Republic , but he got accustomed to it very soon .
Over here , all dogs wear a muzzle and are led by their owner .
On public buses , dogs sit or lie down , and are unusually quiet . People next to them do not feel any danger .
Although there are many dogs in the city of Prague , there is no need to worry about stepping on `` land mines '' on the roads .
Dog owners are generally very conscious . When they go out , they are usually prepared to clean up the excrement of their beloved dog at all times .
However , dogs are after all not toys without a life .
The relevant departments have a series of quite comprehensive control measures for the dogs and dog owners .
Within four months of a puppy's birth , the dog owner must register at the relevant departments . The registration information is so detailed it is almost strict : date of birth , registration number , name and address of the dog owner , dog tax receipt , dog insurance number , whether there are records of injuring people , relevant information such as date of vaccination , gender of the dog , and so on . If it is a female dog , the delivery date and quantity , as well as the breed , of the puppies , whether they are pure breed or hybrid , have to be indicated .
If the dog changes owner or if the owner changes address , the registration information must be updated immediately .
Within 200 meters of a residential or public activity area , the dog must wear a muzzle and dog leash .
Without a dog leash , there will be a fine of 5000 koruna ( about 240 US dollars ).
The local government has demarcated areas where dogs are forbidden to enter . The maximum fine for violation of this can be as high as 20000 koruna ( about 1000 US dollars ).
According to a report by the Japanese media on the 1st , when Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was interviewed by media , such as CNN from the United States and the Financial Times from Britain , at the prime minister's residence on October 31 , he said he will revise the constitution .
Abe said that his office term as the president of the Liberal Democratic Party is three years and he can only stay for two terms , hence he wants to revise the constitution while he is still in office .
Concerning the specific details on the constitution revision , Abe said that in the current constitution , article nine is `` a typical provision that does not fit the times . ''
Whether judging from the perspective of protecting Japan or areas such as making contributions to the international community , article nine should be amended .
In addition , as new values , the constitution should also include protection of earth environment , protection of personal privacy , and so on .
According to the report , this is the first time Abe has talked about the specific details of the constitution revision since he came to office .
Article nine of the pacifist constitution established by Japan at the end of World War II specifies that Japan `` forever renounces war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes . In order to accomplish this aim , Japan will not maintain land , sea , or air forces , as well as other war forces . The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized . ''

According to the statistics from Germany's Federal Labor Department , this May , the supply of engineers in the labor market in Germany had a shortfall of about 12700 people and the supply of technicians had a shortfall of about 9600 people .
In order to protect native employment , Germany has set a relatively high threshold for bringing in foreign talents .
Germany's Immigration Law stipulates that professionals from non-EU countries should have annual salaries of no less than 85500 euros in Germany , otherwise they cannot get the permit to work and live in Germany .
Schavan suggests that this qualifying amount be reduced to 40000 to 60000 euros .
It was learned at the press conference held by the State Council Information Office that starting from July 1 this year , China will implement the Ad hoc Tax-free Registration Policy for Chinese-owned International Shipping Vessels to encourage Chinese-owned vessels flying foreign flags to register back in the country so as to acquire the nationality of the People's Republic of China and sail under the five-star red flag .
In order to further promote the healthy growth of the maritime shipping industry in our country and expand the national fleet and address the relevant problems arising from a considerable number of our country's vessels engaged in international shipping registering overseas and operating under foreign flags , the Ministry of Communications has recently issued `` The Public Notice Regarding the Implementation of the Ad hoc Tax-free Registration Policy for Chinese-owned International Shipping Vessels , " clarifying the conditions for enjoying the ad hoc tax-free policy and the application procedures . Starting from July 1 this year , eligible vessels which submit import declarations within two years shall be exempt from customs duties and import VAT .
Applicant vessels may choose Shanghai , Tianjin , or Dalian as their ports of nationality to process vessel registration .
When people go out traveling , they are looking for relaxation , freshness , and freedom , enjoying as much as possible the natural scenery and achievements of civilized society .
However , while traveling in the country , many people have experienced such nuisance as being besieged and cornered by peddlers and middlemen in public places .
Whether you are getting on or off a bus or train , you invariably suffer the harassment of peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen .
They either sell chicken eggs , peanuts , or sesame seed cakes , or newspapers and magazines . In addition , many unlicensed middlemen make referrals to restaurants and lodgings , even hawking fake certificates , fake receipts , and so on .
If you don't take them , he can chase you for several hundreds of meters as if he would rather die than fail .
In some scenic spots , many tourists also have the same experience .
Before you enter the main gate , someone would come to hawk things like tourist souvenirs and small pieces of arts and crafts .
There are more scenarios of this kind after you go through the gate , which completely ruins even your best mood .
Some media once reported that many foreign tourists coming to Xi'an praised endlessly the places of historic interest and scenic beauty in Xi'an , but felt it was incomprehensible that crowds of peddlers are allowed to hawk their wares everywhere .
Such public places including bus stations and scenic spots are places meant for traveling and recreation . Attention should be paid to civility and orderliness as well as tranquility and harmony , providing tourists a comfortable and relaxing environment .
The unrestricted entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb the mood of tourists , but also actually destroy the public order of these public places , giving rise to the visual contamination and environmental contamination , while providing the conditions and opportunities for lawless people to make trouble .
The important thing is that these public places are the windows of spiritual civilization construction in the local areas . A small glimpse can reveal a larger picture . Not only the image is being damaged but the growth of local economy will also be impacted .
Just imagine , if you want to expand and strengthen the tourism industry but welcome guests traveling from all directions with such a messy tourist environment , who will still want to come , and who still dare to come ?
Then how can your tourist economy gain returns ?
As the tourist high season approaches , creating a civilized tourist environment for tourists coming from all directions should be considered the top priority .
Public places are not markets . The operation by peddlers should be regulated . Unlicensed operation must be resolutely banned , and there should be relentless crackdown on illegal activities .
Only a civilized and orderly environment can get tourists to come happily , who will leave after fully enjoying themselves and keep the passion for a return trip .
In a word , keep public places from the harassment of peddlers .
On July 10 , Liu Gangyi , the party committee secretary of Mulan Township , Xindu District , Chengdu City , who is the first township party committee secretary through public nomination and direct election in the whole country , received his fourth democratic evaluation since he took office . The rate of satisfaction reached 97 %.
During his conversation with reporters , Liu Gangyi defined himself as a `` service provider . ''
The `` service provider '' as spoken by Liu Gangyi is probably more truthful and more believable than the `` service provider '' as spoken by some appointed cadres .
The greatest advantage of public nomination and direct election as compared with the system of appointment lies in the fact that in the former the source of power is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses , while in the latter it is mainly appointed by upper-level organizations . And where the power originates determines that the former must take its responsibility to the general public as top priority .
The source of power and to whom they should answer are the basic factors that determine how the elected will go about their work .
Some people suspect that this kind of `` democratic evaluation '' is more like a `` democracy show . ''
My opinion is that it is better to have this form of `` democratic evaluation '' than nothing at all .
Considering the history and current status of China's grassroots democratic and political construction , I think that it is already a major breakthrough to have public nomination and direction election . Being a major component of this innovation , the democratic evaluation is not to be underestimated in promoting the grassroots democratic and political construction .
US President Bush said on the 21st that the US will fully support the Pakistani government in driving al Qaeda and Taliban extremists out of the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan .
In his regular weekly radio address that day , Bush said that according to the latest US intelligence , al Qaeda has found a `` safe haven '' in the area of Pakistan bordering Afghanistan .
He expressed `` serious concern '' over this .
Bush said that the US will continue to support Pakistani President Musharraf , believing that Musharraf will persistently fight against al Qaeda and Taliban militants .
It is noted in the National Intelligence Estimate report recently released by the US that Islamic militant organizations , Bin Laden's al Qaeda in particular , still constitute a persistent threat to the US .
The agreement reached by Musharraf and some tribal leaders in the northern region of Pakistan last September on guarding against the remnant forces of the Taliban and activities of al Qaeda members has failed to achieve the expected result .
These tribal leaders `` were unwilling or unable '' to maintain the security of the region on their own .
In this prerecorded address , Bush said that Musharraf is taking active steps to correct this mistake .
A long-term follow-up research by glacier experts at the Swiss Academy of Sciences found that from 1850 to 2005 the 1800 plus glaciers in Switzerland were shrinking at an annual rate of 3 %.
The heat wave in 2003 alone caused the Alps glacier to melt by 1.8 %
Experts believe that if the global temperature rises by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100 , the glaciers will have shrunk by 80 % compared with the present and that with a temperature rise of 5 degrees Celsius , the glaciers will have entirely melted .
The Aletsch glacier is the longest glacier in Europe and has been inscribed on the list of the UNESCO Natural World Heritage . However , from 2005 to 2006 , it shrank by 100 meters within a year . There can be no more delay in protecting the natural environment .

Xinhua Agency , Nanjing , November 4 ( by correspondents Deng Huaning , Ling Junhui ): During the fifth annual summit on Chinese automobile industry development , convened here on the 4th , Li Xinmin , vice chairman of the Department of Pollution Control of the State Environmental Protection Administration , indicated that in recent years , because of the rapid increase of the number of vehicles in cities , air pollution in cities is changing from coal-smoke type pollution to coal-smoke type and vehicles combined pollution . Some large and medium cities are frequently under hazy weather .
Li Xinmin said automobile ownerships in China now number 31 million .
Because vehicles use low quality fuels , and the emission standard is low , vehicles have become an important polluting source in large and medium cities , directly causing an increase in hazy weather in cities and an increase in cities polluted by automobile tailpipe exhaust .
Li Xinmin said that the so-called hazy weather refers to the great concentration of nitrogen oxide and particulate matters that leads to low visibility .
In recent years , under favorable climate conditions , region-wide hazy weather frequently appears .
A popular saying goes : `` A new official applies new measures . ''
Experience clearly shows that any new leader would aspire to be able to `` assume an office ; perform a dose of benevolence . '' No new officials would lack the impulse to display surpassing strengths , rack up achievements , and gain the approval by the people as quickly as possible .
Therefore , one can't blame new local party leaders , after the changing of the leadership , for wanting to show quick and numerous accomplishments . And it's quite normal , in the years of changing of the leadership , to see great accomplishment and progress made in the economy .
This year , in view of an evident increase in the central government's dynamism in macro adjustment and of an increasingly powerful momentum in investments in fixed assets , the enthusiasm of different localities in competing in the speed of economic growth is undiminished . `` Changing of the guard '' is perhaps an important propelling factor .
From a search on the Internet , one can discover that , in the recent period , such phrases as `` accelerated development '' and `` grand deeds and quick progress '' can frequently be found in the talk of many local leaders .
Admittedly , it is impossible for economic social development not to be affected by the political cycle of `` the changing of the leadership . '' But if the results of some local `` changing of the leadership '' deviate from the original development plan and turn into another set of development thinking , then either the economic price or the political price would be heavy .
Xinhua News Agency , Baghdad , Nov . 14 ( reporter Zhang Wei ) - According to a report by Iraqi state television on the 14th , a group of armed militia dressed in police uniform charged into a building of Iraq's Ministry of Higher Education in downtown Baghdad and left by cars after kidnapping approximately 100 people on that day .
The report claimed that at around 9:30 that morning , the group of armed militia arrived in front of an office building of a research institute under Iraq's Ministry of Higher Education in Karrada area in downtown Baghdad in several vehicles .
They lied that the US Ambassador to Iraq would soon arrive for a tour and they were Iraqi security personnel who came to conduct an inspection .
After they were let inside , they kidnapped the people in the building and separated the hostages according to their gender .
The women were locked in a room and their cell phones were confiscated while the men including workers , security personnel , and visitors were forced into the vehicles and brought away .
However , according to the information provided by an official of Iraq's Ministry of Interior to the reporter of Xinhua News Agency , the group of armed militia carried out the kidnapping in 20 vehicles at the time .
At present , Iraqi security forces are investigating the identity of this group of armed militia and the result is still unknown .
According to an Agence France-Presse report on the 14th , the census taken by the Census Bureau this year showed that the 2005 median income of Asian American families is US$ 60367, higher than that of white families . But the median income of Asian Americans was US$ 27201, slightly lower than that of whites .
In 2005 , 13.5 % of Americans lived below the poverty line . Among whom , 9 % were whites , 11.5 % of Asian descent , 22.4 % of Latin American descent , and 25.6 % of African descent .
The standard of calculation for the poverty line in the United States applies to individuals who make less than US$ 10000 a year or families ( of four ) who make less than US$ 20000 a year .
In terms of family income , if the factor of the number of children within a family is excluded , the income differences among families of different ethnicities are less than those shown by the data .
Roberto Ramirez , the person in charge of the Census Bureau's ethnic affairs , said that this census , using a 10-year-long experimental survey as a basis , was designed chiefly to meet the increasing social needs for interrelated survey data .
The census sampled all the 300 million families in the United States . The census report comprised 1000 forms .
On July 1 , the Eternal Warning Bell in the Memorial Hall of Nanjing's Jinghai Temple was tolled once again , the sound of the bell ringing melodiously .
This rich echo of history connected the mainland and Hong Kong via television , as the citizens of Nanjing and Hong Kong compatriots `` shared the same occasion from the far corners of the earth '' and celebrated together the tenth anniversary of Hong Kong's reversion to the motherland .
Ten years previously , at 12:00 a.m. on July 1 , the sound of the tolling of the Eternal Warning Bell reverberated 155 times in the sky over the bell tower of the Memorial Hall of Nanjing's Jinghai Temple , bidding farewell to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong island .
People from all walks of life in Nanjing society gathered together in front of the gate of the smallish Memorial Hall . They said that they wanted to give an eternal warning to themselves and to later generations not to forget history by ringing this Eternal Warning Bell with their own two hands .
`` The bell of the Eternal Warning Bell is 1.842 meters high , and the year 1842 was precisely when the `` Nanjing Treaty '' was concluded at the time of the eruption of the Opium War .
The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high , and 1997 was the year of Hong Kong's reversion . ''
The man behind the devising and casting of the Eternal Warning Bell that year , Wang Fengling , explained that `` there are five `` wan '' character inscriptions around the body of the bell . The whole copper bell is in high relief , with two dragons supporting a fireball , symbolizing the fact that Hong Kong is the motherland's `` Pearl of the Orient . '' Finally , Nanjing's city flower , the plum blossom , forms the pattern on the body of the bell where the bell is struck . ''
Yu Xiaodong , a member of the Democratic Party and the first person back then to propose the construction of the Eternal Warning Bell sighed with emotion , saying , `` Before we knew it , it has been ten years already since the reversion of Hong Kong . '' He hopes that Hong Kong's tomorrow could be like the sound of that tolling bell , `` resounding and melodious , ongoing and everlasting . ''
Over the course of the current year , all departments in all parts of Guangxi have launched a movement to transform cadres' style of work and strengthen the building of administrative efficiency in official bodies , implementing the `` three systems : " the `` ask first '' responsibility system , the time-limited case-handling system and the accountability system . Thirty-three key approval departments directly under the autonomous region and 135 responsible posts have been brought into the administrative efficiency inspection work network .
So far , 619 people have been held to account .
On the 5th this reporter learned from the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that Guangxi has currently formed a rudimentary administrative efficiency inspection work network at the autonomous region , municipality and county levels . They are strengthening inspection of key departments and responsible posts , and the electronic inspection systems of 14 municipalities have been completely linked with that of the autonomous region .
The autonomous region's electronic system for the inspection of administrative efficiency is directly connected to 33 key approval departments directly under the autonomous region and 135 responsible posts that deal with the investment environment and the production and life of the masses , further standardizing their approval behavior and raising their approval efficiency .
At the same time , all levels of Guangxi's discipline inspection supervision bodies are solemnly investigating cases that touch on the efficiency of workstyles or harm the interests of the people . So far , they have investigated and verified 1104 cases and concluded 769 cases , and held to account 584 work units and 619 individuals .
The secretary of the standing committee of Guangxi Autonomous Region's party committee and discipline inspection committee , Ma Tieshan , said on the 5th that inspection of administrative efficiency is a task that will accompany administrative activities from beginning to end , and it was necessary to gradually put in place a long-term and effective mechanism .
Guangxi is to further perfect and standardize all of its administrative management regulations and systems , and set up and perfect an administrative efficiency inspection work mechanism and safeguard system , so as to put efficiency inspection on an institutionalized and standardized track ; further standandize supervision and inspection procedures , strengthen and improve the complaint resolution mechanism and performance evaluation and assessment mechanism ; step up accountability , and use a strict accountability system to ensure the practical implementation of the `` ask first '' responsibility system , the time-limited case-handling system , and other work systems .
Two Jordanese men were sentenced by the Jordanian State Security Court on the 11th for plotting to attack Americans in Jordan .
Of the two men , both aged 25 , one called Sameeh al-Hotari was sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment with forced labor , and the other called Mohammed Shehada was sentenced to three years' imprisonment with forced labor .
A court official said that al-Hotari was also charged with illegal possession of firearms , and that the police had found an assault rifle while searching his place of residence .
The court originally decided to sentence al-Hotari to life imprisonment , but later considered giving him an opportunity to `` turn over a new leaf , " and reduced the sentence to 8 years .
According to the indictment , after the outbreak of the Iraq war the two accused decided to avenge the Muslims who were `` being bullied by the Americans , " and plotted to attack Americans living in Jordan .
In August 2006 they selected as a target an American living in a suburb of the Jordanian capital , Amman , but were arrested by the police before carrying out an attack on him .
The identity of this American was not made public in the indictment .
The indictment also charged the two defendants with planning to attack other Americans , but no concrete details were divulged .
US President Bush gave an address on the 16th in Washington , calling for the holding of an international conference on the Palestine-Israel issue this fall , and inviting Israel , Palestine and some of the surrounding Arab countries and other countries concerned to take part , in order to jointly push for the restarting of the Middle East peace process .
On the 17th , Bush also made separate phone calls to Egypt's President Mubarak , Jordan's King Abdullah II , and Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah , asking them to respond positively to this proposal , give practical support to Abbas , the president of the Palestinian National Authority , and help the Palestinians and the Israelis to resume peace talks at an early date .

The UN Security Council passed a unanimous resolution on the 30th , agreeing to extend the term of UN peacekeeping troops based in Ethiopia and Eritrea ( UNMEE ) by six months until January 31 next year .
The resolution requires all the parties concerned to fulfill their commitments , continue exercising restraint , ease the tense situation and avoid provocative military activities ; calling on Eritrea to pull its troops and heavy military equipment out of the Temporary Security Zone immediately and calling on Ethiopia to reduce the number of additional military troops recently deployed in the vicinity of the Temporary Security Zone .
The resolution requires Ethiopia to immediately take concrete steps to allow the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission to speedily demarcate the border without any preconditions ; and requires Eritrea to cancel all of its restrictions on UNMEE's actions and operations without any further delay and without setting any preconditions .
The resolution reaffirms the full support for the work of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission , and welcomes the commission's decision to hold talks with both Eritrea and Ethiopia on September 6 in New York .
In 1998 a border conflict broke out between Eritrea and Ethiopia , leading to the loss of more than 70000 lives .
In June 2000 both Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a ceasefire agreement in the Algerian capital of Algiers .
The UN has deployed peacekeeping troops on the Ethiopian-Eritrean border since July 2001 to oversee the implementation of the two countries' ceasefire agreement .
Spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Liu Jianchao stated on the 2nd that China will continue to devote efforts in negotiating with all relevant parties to confirm a time convenient to all parties to resume the talk .
When all parties are ready , `` the sooner the Six Party Talk is convened the better '' .
Liu Jianchao said that China , North Korea , and the United States have reached concrete understanding and consensus to discuss and resolve financial problems within the framework of the Six Party Talks through common efforts .
The six parties have to mutually agree on the time to resume the Six Party Talk , the way it will be conducted , and the issues to be discussed .
Therefore , China still needs to communicate and discuss with Japan , South Korea , and Russia to fix a time to resume the talk that all parties find convenient .
China believes that when all parties are ready , the sooner the Six Party Talk resumes , the better it will be .
Liu Jianchao stressed that China has always opposed to resolving related issues through means of sanction , threat , and pressure .
China believes that dialogue and negotiation is the only and the best way to resolve North Korean nuclear issue .
During the war of resistance against Japan , there was a renowned `` Japanese special agent '' named `` Lin Hongzhou . ''
He was a native of Laiwu and was deeply appreciated by ( Shan Tian ) , chief of staff of the Japanese troops stationed in Shandong .
He was Guo Shantang , an intelligence officer of our Party who penetrated into the highest echelon of the Japanese troops stationed in Shandong .
At the end of 1941 , a group of capable cadres and outstanding fighters were selected from our Luzhong military region to form a special task force , to penetrate into the guerilla warfare regions and enemy-occupied territories . They became the eyes and ears of our troops stationed in these areas .
Guo Shantang was one of the members of this special task force .
He was sent to the center of military activities of the puppet Japanese army - Tai'an - to collect intelligence .
He used various social relations to successfully penetrate into the enemy inner circles and changed his name to `` Lin Hongzhou . ''
Relying on his own wit and bravery , Guo Shantang penetrated deeper and deeper into the inner circles of the puppet Japanese army .
He first became a special task force member of ( Shan Tian ) , chief of staff of the Japanese troops stationed in Shandong . Later , he was fought over by four Japanese spy agencies in Ji'nan .
( Shan Ben ) , chief of the military police squadron in Ji'nan , even issued an official certificate to him .
Guo Shantang , deeply trusted by the Japanese , continuously supplied the intelligence he collected to me via my fifth older brother , Wang Chunfeng . Of course , I also passed on some irrelevant intelligence to him to feed to the Japanese spy agencies .
In this way , Guo Shantang concealed himself in the tiger's lair for a long time .
A member of Iraq's internal government said on the 8th that a soccer field in Sadr City , in the eastern part of the capital , Baghdad , where many Shiite Muslims lived , was hit by several mortar shells in a surprise attack , killing eight people and wounding 20 .
This official , who declined to be named , told a Xinhua Agency reporter that the surprise attack took place that evening , when a game was in progress on the soccer field .
Those killed and wounded include players and spectators .
And according to information from Iraq's internal government , there were many other surprise attacks in Baghdad that day that targeted the police and citizens , resulting in least five dead and 26 wounded .
The Iraqi Supreme Court announced on the 5th that former president Saddam Hussein was sentenced to death by hanging for crimes against humanity he committed in the town of Dujail .
Because of concerns over the escalation of violent surprise attacks after the sentencing announcement , the Iraqi government imposed curfew on Baghdad on the 5th and the 6th .
After the curfew was lifted on the 7th , violent surprise attacks seemed to escalate again in Baghdad .
There were many surprise attacks in Baghdad on the 7th , resulting in at least 22 dead and 40 wounded .
The first is the identification function .
It is an important sign that distinguishes the armies of different countries , different military services , and between the military and civilians .
In the armies of more than 100 large and small countries of the world , although the use of military uniform is basically identical , there are no two countries' armies whose military uniforms are completely the same .
The second is the symbolic function .
To a certain extent , military uniform is both a reflection of a country's mental outlook and its national characteristics , and is also a concentrated embodiment of a country's military ability to wage war and the quality of its servicemen .
In the three main types of military uniform - ceremonial attire , everyday uniforms , and drill uniforms - the one that can express national prestige and military prestige to the fullest extent is none other than ceremonial attire that is well-pressed and pleasing to the eye .
The third is the protective function .
With the rapid development of high-tech and updated weaponry , improving the overall protective capacity of new-style drill uniforms to give military uniform various types of functions - including bulletproofing , stealth protection , anti-chemical , anti-bacterial and anti-radiation functions , as well as control of the temperature , humidity and the air - has become a key issue in the development of military uniform .
Report by Correspondent Zhang Shun : A member of the Central Military Commission and commander of the Air Force , Qiao Qingchen met the party of Bangladeshi Chief of Air Staff Ziaur Rahman in Beijing today .
Qiao Qingchen said that since China and Bangladesh had established diplomatic relations , relations between the two countries had always developed smoothly , that high-level contacts were frequent , and that friendly exchanges and cooperation in various fields were continuously being strengthened .
The two countries , whether in international affairs or in each country's domestic construction , trusted each other , supported each other , helped each other , and acted in close coordination with each other .
The Chinese side appreciated and was grateful for the support Bangladesh gave China on the issues of Taiwan , human rights , Tibet , and others .
Qiao Qingchen said that the Chinese armed forces prized the development of friendly relations with the Bangladeshi armed forces and hoped that through the common efforts of the two sides they will be able to further enlarge the scope and level of friendly cooperation between the two armies , strengthen friendly exchanges and cooperation between the air forces of the two countries , and raise the friendly cooperative relationship between the two armies that has already been established to a new level .
Zia said that the Bangladeshi side will exert vigorous efforts to further develop friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two armed forces of Bangladesh and China , particularly between the two countries' air forces .
He reaffirmed that the Bangladeshi government will support the one-China policy , just as it has always done .
Before the meeting , Qiao Qingchen held a welcome ceremony for the Zia visit .
Zia arrived in Beijing on July 8 to begin an official friendly visit to our country at an invitation from Qiao Qingchen .
Staff Writer , Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin : On June 18 , at a training class for People's Armed Force full-time cadres in Jingjiang city in Jiangsu province , Lu Yuqing , leader of the People's Armed force department of Xilai township , delivered a training lecture `` Winning a Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions '' that received a unanimous favorable assessment from the trainees .
This was a new change that was brought about by the city's People's Armed Force when it has put more pressure on its cadres based on the reality of their positions in an effort to raise People's Armed Force cadres' comprehensive quality .
At the beginning of this year , the People's Armed force party committee discovered during investigation and research at the grassroots level that some of the People's Armed Force cadres had served for a long time , had too many concurrent duties , and had not put their chief energies into the armed force work .
For this reason , they have adopted methods including centralized training , replacing training with meetings , and relying on local party schools to conduct training , thus regularly training military cadres , in an effort to resolve problems such as the narrow knowledge base and the uniform focus of the professional quality of military cadres .
In combination with the central work , they boldly assign tasks to military cadres and put more pressure on them , and raise their performance by on-the-job training .
At the same time , they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly drafted the `` People's Armed Forces Cadres' Competition for Jobs Scheme , " and explicitly stipulated that the leaders of People's Armed Forces departments must join the party committee of the same level and cannot concurrently take on other jobs .
They have set up a military cadres' restructuring exchange mechanism to promptly regulate exchanges on some older military cadres who are not suitable for grassroots People's Armed forces work , and promote and use some comrades of good comprehensive quality and strong work ability .
Not long ago , a domestic gap was filled by the underwater boat-welding technology invented and developed by the People's Militia technology platoon under the leadership of the secretary of the armed department of the New Century Shipbuilding Company Limited , Chen Yisong , who was exceptionally promoted as the company's armed department leader .
Report by Li Guoliang and Huang Qi : For many years , Guangdong's Frontier Defense Unit Hospital , while doing a good job ensuring army medical service , has also done all it can to aid the masses who have found themselves in straitened circumstances , their compassion soothing the hearts of the common people everywhere .
This morning , a celebratory meeting to mark the conferring by the Public Security Ministry of a Collective Ward of Merit , Second Class , on Guangdong's Frontier Defense Unit Hospital , together with a public lecture on the exemplary deeds of the army in supporting the government and cherishing the people , was solemnly held in Shenzhen .
The Guangdong Frontier Unit Hospital , which has set itself the task of building socialist harmony , has successively established three fair-price hospitals specially aimed at migrant laborers in Buji , Longhua and Bao'an of Shenzhen . The registration fee for migrant laborers seeking medical advice is only 1 yuan , and discounts of 20 % are available for both tests and operations .
The hospital is provided with a special `` Compassionate Service Vehicle , " which takes peasant migrant patients to and from the clinic free of charge , and has rolled out a migrant peasant worker `` Health Service Card , " whereby each person needs to pay just 7 yuan a month to enjoy 12 types of basic medical treatment consultations and guarantees .
These measures to benefit the people have already been extended to more than 12000 migrant peasant workers .
Since 2003 , the hospital has also launched large-scale compassionate charity consultation events under the title `` Lighting a Thousand Lamps , " and has organized eight successive trips to send ophthalmic doctors and nurses to distant places such as Tibet , Jiangxi , Yunnan , and Qinghai to `` bring light and health , " performing nearly 3000 cataract operations free of charge , helping sufferers to see again .
Staff Writer , Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing : The situation in the `` small , scattered , far and direct '' units where education organization is difficult , resources are meager , and each fends for itself , will become history at a second artillery unit base .
This correspondent learned recently that following a half-year pilot project , this base has handed down `` The Method of Fully Implementing `` An Outline for Ideological and Political Education '' . '' A number of ideological and political education coordination zones covering all the `` small , scattered , far and direct '' units in the base have officially been brought into operation .
In order to push ahead with the effective implementation of `` An Outline for Ideological and Political Education , " the base organized resources at the beginning of the year to conduct in-depth investigation and research of the ideological and political education situation in `` small , scattered , far and direct '' units . They combed through important issues that influence and restrict the education time , personnel and results , and initially established this new-style education model of coordination zones for the `` small , scattered , far and direct '' units .
The concrete approach of coordination zones is to break down the organizational boundaries among units and set up a brigade and regiment-level unit to take the lead in the areas where the `` small , scattered , far and direct '' units are relatively concentrated , and conduct an integrated program for thematic education , with units falling under different hierarchies coming together in nearby places for lectures or using the help of video link-up systems for remote discussions .
They have adopted a method that integrates taking turns in giving lessons and competing for posts , and unifying the allocation of educational resources . In each area the use of educational hardware will be integrated , and each unit's materials , data and educational experiences will be shared and exchanged with those of others , with regular organization in each area of typical tour reports and exchanges of what they got from the study by the officers and men .
Every coordination zone has set up a devoted educational liaison person and a part-time educational information gatherer .
On this basis , each coordination zone has also set up systems for seeking assistance on difficult issues , holding joint discussions on major educational themes , reporting critical ideological situations , and assessing tests and evaluations .
Zhang Shengmin , the director of the base's political department , told this correspondent that constructing political education coordination zones has both reduced the waste of educational resources and deepened the impact of education .
Some political instructors fear they will lose marks in front of officers and men from other units and have taken the initiative to study new things and seek new educational methods .
The officers and men receiving the education have also enthusiastically digested the educational content , out of concern over expressing themselves in layman's language in front of the officers and men of friendly neighboring units during discussion and analysis .
In this way , the enthusiasm of the people giving and receiving education has been both effectively stimulated .
Report by Wang Weiqin and Specially Contracted Correspondent Li Deying : On July 25 , this writer observed in a service support company of the Ji'nan Military Command that invitations for an army engineering tender , details of financial expenditure , promotions of cadres , non-commissioned officers being admitted to the Party and other major matters were written up on a bulletin board , and hung up conspicuously in a display cabinet .
As Political Commissar Su Chengsen explained , this is a concrete measure adopted by the section to promote a system where things are done openly .
At the beginning of this year , the unit party committee drew up measures including `` Two-way Supervision Between the Organization and the Grassroots '' and `` Publicizing Sensitive Issues '' to strengthen the construction of the party spirit and honest government , requiring that for all significant issues that involve the direct interests of the officers and men and army development , the opinions of grassroots officers and men are first heard before decisions are reached , and that standards , procedures , and results etc of the handling of the matters are made public from start to finish in line with the circumstances .
The unit has installed a suggestion box and a bulletin board , and has opened a `` message board '' on its Intranet to collect everyone's views and recommendations in an extensive way .
At the beginning of the year , as the renovation project of the soldiers' barracks was about to start , before the work began , the party committee organ extensively solicited the views of the officers and men , and then released the information on inviting bids , implementing a system of open tenders .
This both saved money and won the support of the officers and men .
Doing things in an open and fair way has driven the formation of a good atmosphere at the grassroots .
In this unit , the grassroots company insists on making regular public announcements and notices , no matter whether they are issues as big as the determination of `` hot-button '' sensitive matters , or as trivial as personal vacations to visit relatives or daily income and expenditure in the mess accounts , thus taking the initiative to receive the supervision of the masses .
According to a report in the Venezuelan media on the 3rd , the US team's 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper , Keller , said during an interview here that if he could not find a suitable club to serve in after the America's Cup , then he would opt to retire .
`` If I have not been able to get a contract for 1-2 seasons with a high-quality league team within four to six weeks of the conclusion of the America's Cup , then maybe retiring will not be a bad choice for me . ''
With the relegation of the Möchengladbach team to the 2nd Bundesliga , Keller also left this soccer team in which he had served for more than two seasons .
Although Keller has a mind to retire , he has many opportunities and clearly need not worry about finding a place . He himself has frankly stated that there are currently as many as eight soccer teams that are interested in inviting him to join them .
However , this veteran goalkeeper who has served in league matches for the Spanish Primera Liga , the English Premiership , and the German Bundesliga , said that what he ultimately chooses to do will be decided by his family . `` My kid is already 9 years old . He has followed me around and stayed in three different countries , and has been to three different schools , and so I need to consider in my current choice what would be better for my family . ''
In the Gold Cup competition that was concluded not long ago , Keller put in an outstanding performance , helping the US team to win the title .
In the current America's cup , he has , just as before , been given an important job to do by head coach Bradley , but he clearly cannot win the match singlehanded . The US team , made up of `` young guards , " is no match for such strong South American opponents as Argentina and Paraguay , and during these two matches the goal he guarded was breached seven times .
The next match against Colombia will probably be the US team's and Keller's last performance in this America's Cup competition .

Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , July 28 ( Correspondent Cui Junqiang ) When the Olympic Games are held next year , Beijing is expected to turn into a sea of fresh flowers in hot and humid August .
By season-altering and other technological methods , scientific and research personnel have found a good way of adding more color to the Olympic Games .
At the `` Practical Research into the Selection and Cultivation of New Plant Varieties for the Summer Olympics '' project evaluation meeting held on the 28th in Beijing , the experts making the evaluation came to the conclusion that by the use of new rapid-control cultivation technologies , plant species or varieties with different natural flowering seasons could blossom at the same time in the summer and reach an optimum result for people to enjoy in August when the Beijing Olympics are held .
In the summer in Beijing , one can usually see only a dozen or so fresh flowers in full bloom , as the majority of flowering plants have either long withered or are far away from blossoming .
The scientific and research personnel worked hard to select 206 species and more than 400 varieties of plants for the Summer Olympic Games .
At the `` 2007 Olympic Games Plant and Flower Show '' to be held in Beijing's Haidian park around the one year countdown before the Beijing Olympics open , a batch of plants meticulously cultivated by scientific and research personnel that previously could not naturally flower in August will welcome visitors with their gaily-colored flowers .
